## Change HTTPClient handler factory creation

The handler factory for creating handlers for new requests is now provided in the constructor of the client instead of the apply method. This makes it more clear, that the client will use the same handler for all requests.

The old version would look similar to this:

```pony
let client = HTTPClient(auth)

// Later
let handler_factory = ...

client(payload, handler_factory)?

// Even later
client(other_payload, other_factory)
```

In the new version the handler factory needs to be supplied at the creation of the client:

```pony
let handler_factory = ...
let client = HTTPClient(auth, handler_factory)

client(payload)

// This will use the handler_factory
client(other_payload)

// To use a different handler factory, create a new client

let other_client = Client(auth, other_factory)
other_client(other_payload)
```
